# Training for the prevention of fires and explosions through the use of data analysis and simulation
Data of this repository is part of the project entitled Training for the prevention of fires and explosions through the use of data analysis and simulation, sponsored by the Royal Academy of Engineering under its Transforming Systems through Partnership 20/21 award with reference TSP2021\100311. The project was executed by Universidad Nacional de Colombia Sede Medellín, University College London (UCL), Agencia Nacional de Minería and Soluciones Energéticas y de Automatización.

The repository contains six .zip folders, which are explained below. Many of the documents of this repository are written in spanish as they are oriented for the Colombian engineering community.

## Case i. Tópaga mine explosion
An explosion that occurred in an underground coal mine was analyzed and modeled. This folder contains:
1. Lecture notes: detailed description of the case study.
2. Manual: tutorial to model the case study through Ansys Fluent.
3. Unit 1 - Mining and Environment subject: slides presented in the Mining and Environment subjec course at the Univesidad Nacional de Colombia Sede Medellín (UNAL-MED). Elective course of different engineering programs.
## Case ii. Fire in a tank storage facility
An explosion and subsequent fire in a tank storage facility was analyzed and modeled. This folder contains:
1. Lecture notes: detailed description of the case study.
2. Manual: tutorial to model the case study through Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS).
3. Unit 1 - Introduction to Chemical Engineering course: slides presented in the Introduction to Chemical Engineering course at the UNAL-MED. Madatory course of beginning undergraduate chemical engineering students.
4. Unit 1 - Process Engineering course: slides presented in the first class Process Engineering course at the UNAL-MED. Madatory course of advanced undergraduate chemical engineering students.
5. Unit 2 - Process Engineering course: slides presented in the second class in the Process Engineering course at the UNAL-MED. Madatory course of advanced undergraduate chemical engineering students.
## Case iii. Fire in a plastic processing factory
A fire in a plastic processing factory was analyzed and modeled. This folder contains:
1. Lecture notes: detailed description of the case study. Due to confidentiality reasons, original photos of the incident cannot be shown.
2. Manual: tutorial to model the case study through FDS.
3. Unit 1 - Fires and Explosions Simulation Laboratory course: document presented in Fires and Explosions Simulation Laboratory course at the UNAL-MED. Mandatory course of the Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) Specialization in Engineering against Fires and Explosions (SEAFE).
## Case iv. Fire in a vehicle tunnel
Due to the importance of tunnels in Colombia, and the large number of outbreak of fire that occur in them, a hypothetical case of a tunnel fire was described and modeled. This folder contains:
1. Manual: tutorial to model the case study through FDS.
2. Unit 1 - Fires and Explosions Simulation Laboratory course: document of the module presented in Fires and Explosions Simulation Laboratory course at the UNAL-MED. Mandatory course of the M.Eng. SEAFE.
## Case v. Tasco mine explosion
A methane and coal dust explosion that occurred in an underground coal mine was described and modeled. This folder contains:
1. Tasco mine explosion: A self-contained document with a description of the models implemented in python and Cantera softwares, lines of code, and an explanation of the lines of code developed.
2. README: A readme file that explains the first document and has links to download the necessary softwares.
## Supplementary exercises.
This folder contains eight supplementary exercises for modeling different phenomena related to fires and explosions, which were implemented in the Fires and Explosions Simulation Laboratory course, Mandatory course of the M.Eng. SEAFE.
