# Training for the prevention of fires and explosions through the use of data analysis and simulation
Data of this repository is part of the project entitled Training for the prevention of fires and explosions through the use of data analysis and simulation, funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering under its Transforming Systems through Partnership 20/21 award with reference TSP2021\100311. The project was executed by Universidad Nacional de Colombia Sede Medellín, University College London (UCL), Agencia Nacional de Minería and Soluciones Energéticas y de Automatización.

The repository contains the description of five cases of fires and explosions that occurred in Colombia and the tutorials to model them through physical modelling tools. Additionally, it contains supplementary exercises on fire and explosion modelling through physical modelling tools. The order of the datas is:

1. Case i. Tópaga mine explosion
2. Case ii. Fire in a tank storage facility
3. Case iii. Fire in a plastic processing factory
4. Case iv. Fire in a vehicle tunnel
